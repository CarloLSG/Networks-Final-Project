# Networks-Final-Project
The objective of this project is to design a secure, sustainable and scalable business network for UPCTEC S.A. To achieve this, the network structure of each branch and its division by areas will be defined, which will allow the segmentation of the subnetworks and their subsequent connection for better organization.
